Assignment 4 reflections.

Please answer the questions below:

1. How did this assignment go for you? (Please write several sentences.)

This assignment went well for me. Since I took linear algebra last year, I was fairly familiar with
most of the matrix computations required for the assignment. As a result, I was able to code them in a 
fairly straightforward manner. 

2. What was hard about this assignment?

I guess one hard part was when I was briefly confused about what it meant to raise a matrix to a power. 
Additionally, writing a makefile and doing my own tests were time-intensive, but helpful. 

3. What would you like to know more about?

I would like you to know that I will be doing a software engineering internship this summer 
with Lockheed Martin. 

4. How long did this assignment take you? (Do not include time spent on the readings.)

This assignment took me about 8-10 hours, but I am also very thorough and did a lot of tests.
